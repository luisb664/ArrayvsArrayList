Arrays: A very basic data structure that comes with a predetermined size which cannot be changed at any point. Will work better when you have planned the exact amount of elements that will be needed for a certain program that will not need to be modified in the future.

Array List: A list of different data types and it is not stuck to just one size. More can be added to the list or be taken away. Will be more viable for instances where there is constant change happening within a program.&nbsp;


Size: The size of an array is predetermined and will no longer change after the fact. Array list can be expanded or shrunken down.

Efficiency/Performance: Arrays are fast because they do not change at all. Array lists are slower but bring a lot of flexibility.

Use Cases: Arrays can be used when there will be elements that will not need to be changed in the future. Array lists are used when changes are constantly happening and instead of changing the size manually, it can all be done within the program.
